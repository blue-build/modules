# [`signing`] Module for Startingpoint

The `signing` module is used to install the required signing policies for cosign image verification with [`rpm-ostree`](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree) and [`bootc`](https://github.com/containers/bootc). This is the successor to the `signing.sh` module that allows for basing off of non-ublue fedora base OCI images.
