readme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blue-build/modules/main/modules/gnome-extensions/README.md
example: |
  type: gnome-extensions
  install:
    - Night Theme Switcher
    - Blur my Shell # Notice how extension is named "Blur my Shell" & not "Blur My Shell"?
                    # Name is case-sensitive, so check if extension name is typed correctly
    - AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support                
    - 307 # Dash-to-Dock
          # https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/
          # You can also specify PK ID number from the extension URL,
          # if you encounter the scenario where there are multiple extensions with the same name.
          # You don't need to look & search for this scenario, since module will automatically fail & inform you to put PK ID number instead
  uninstall:
    - GSConnect # Uninstall step here should be used only for the extensions
                # which are not installed through OS package manager in the base image,
                # like extensions installed from gnome-extensions module
