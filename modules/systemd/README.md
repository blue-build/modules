# `systemd`

The `systemd` module streamlines the management of systemd units during image building. Units are divided into `system` and `user` categories, with `system` units managed directly using `systemctl` and `user` units using `systemctl --global`. You can specify which units to enable/disable or unmask/mask under each category.

Supported operations are [enabling](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemctl.html#enable%20UNIT%E2%80%A6), [disabling](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemctl.html#disable%20UNIT%E2%80%A6), [masking](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemctl.html#mask%20UNIT%E2%80%A6%E2%80%A6) and [unmasking](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemctl.html#unmask%20UNIT%E2%80%A6).
