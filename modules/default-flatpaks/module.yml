  modules: # configured multiple times to highlight how options are overridden
    - type: default-flatpaks

                                         # Only normal flatpak applications are (like Floorp Lightning web browser in this example).

    # a subsequent usage might look like this:

      system:
        # If the repo-* fields are omitted on the subsequent usage,
        # the module will use the previously configured repo.
