name: default-flatpaks
shortdesc: The default-flatpaks module can be used to install or uninstall flatpaks from a configurable remote on every boot.
example: |
  modules: # configured multiple times to highlight how options are overridden
    - type: default-flatpaks
      notify: true # Send notification after install/uninstall is finished (true/false)
      system:
        # If no repo information is specified, Flathub will be used by default
        repo-url: https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
        repo-name: flathub
        repo-title: "Flathub (system-wide)" # Optional; this sets the remote's user-facing name in graphical frontends like GNOME Software
        install:
          - org.gnome.Loupe
          - one.ablaze.floorp//lightning # This is an example of flatpak which has multiple branches in selection (flatpak//branch).
                                         # Flatpak runtimes are not supported (like org.winehq.Wine//stable-23.08).
                                         # Only normal flatpak applications are (like Floorp Lightning web browser in this example).
                                         # Multiple install of same flatpaks with different branches is not supported.
        remove:
          - org.gnome.eog
      # A flatpak repo can also be added without having to install flatpaks,
      # as long as one of the repo- fields is present
      user:
        repo-name: flathub

    # Assuming that the above example is configured first in a recipe,
    # a subsequent usage might look like this:  
    - type: default-flatpaks
      system:
        # If the repo-* fields are omitted on the subsequent usage,
        # the module will use the previously configured repo.
        # Otherwise, it will overwrite the repo configuration.
        install:
          - org.kde.kdenlive # this Flatpak is appended to the install list
      user:
        # repo-name will overwrite the previously-configured repo-name for the user remote
        repo-name: flathub-user
        repo-title: "Flathub (User)
