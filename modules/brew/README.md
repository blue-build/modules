# brew

The brew module installs [Homebrew / Linuxbrew](https://brew.sh/) on your system and ensures the package manager remains updated and maintained. This module also sets up systemd services to periodically update the installed Brew packages.

## Features
- Installs Brew at build-time.
- Sets up systemd services to automatically update Brew to the latest version.
- Sets up systemd services to automatically upgrade Brew packages.
- Sets up bash and fish completions for Brew.

## How it works

### Directory paths glossary:
- `/home/` is a symlink to `/var/home/`  
- `/root/` is a symlink to `/var/roothome/`

### Build-time:

- Necessary Brew package dependency `gcc` is installed if not present in the base image
- Directories `/home/` & `/root/` are created
- Empty `.dockerenv` file is created in the root of the image-builder, to convince official Brew installation script that we are **not** running as root
- Official brew installation script is downloaded & executed
- Brew is extracted to `/home/linuxbrew/` by the official script (`/root/` is needed, since image-builds are running as root)
- Brew in `/home/linuxbrew/` is compressed in tar, copied to `/usr/share/homebrew/` & permissions to it are set to default user (UID 1000)
- `brew-update` & `brew-upgrade` SystemD service timers are enabled (by default)
- A fix for path conflicts between system & brew packages with the same name is applied by adding Brew to path only in interactive shells, unlike what Brew does by default.
- Brew bash & fish shell completions are copied to `/etc/profile.d/brew-bash-completions.sh` & `/usr/share/fish/vendor_conf.d/brew-fish-completions.fish`
- `tmpfiles.d` configuration `homebrew.conf` is written with these directory locations:
  - `/var/lib/homebrew/`
  - `/var/cache/homebrew/`
  - `/home/linuxbrew/`
- `brew-setup` service is enabled

### Boot-time:

**`tmpfiles.d homebrew.conf`:**
- This configuration is telling SystemD to: automatically create these necessary directories on every system boot if not available & to give them permissions of the default user (UID 1000):
  - `/var/lib/homebrew/`
  - `/var/cache/homebrew/`
  - `/home/linuxbrew/`

**`brew-setup`:**
- `brew-setup` SystemD service checks if main directory used by Brew exists (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/`)  
  & if `brew-setup` state file exists (`/etc/.linuxbrew`)
- If one of those paths don't exist, then Homebrew tar is extracted from `/usr/share/homebrew/homebrew.tar.zst` to `/tmp/homebrew/`
- Extracted Homebrew is then copied from `/tmp/homebrew/` to `/home/linuxbrew/` & permissions to it are set to default user (UID 1000)
- Temporary directory `/tmp/homebrew/` is removed
- Empty file `/etc/.linuxbrew` is created, which indicates that brew-setup (installation) is successful & which allows setup to run again on next boot when removed

**Rest of the setup:**
- `brew-update` runs at the specified time to update Brew to the latest version
- `brew-upgrade` runs at the specified time to upgrade Brew packages

## Configuration Options

### Update

The Brew update operation updates the Brew binary to latest version.

#### `auto-update` (optional: boolean, default: true)
If false, disables automatic activation of `brew-update.timer`.

#### `update-interval` (optional: string, default: '6h')
Defines how often the Brew update service should run. The string is passed directly to `OnUnitInactiveSec` in systemd timer. (Syntax: ['1d', '6h', '10m']).

#### `update-wait-after-boot` (optional: string, default: '10min')
Time delay after system boot before the first Brew update runs. The string is passed directly to `OnBootSec` in systemd timer. (Syntax: ['1d', '6h', '10m']).

### Upgrade

The Brew upgrade operation upgrades all installed Brew packages to latest version.

#### `auto-upgrade` (optional: boolean, default: true)
If false, disables automatic activation of `brew-upgrade.timer`.

#### `upgrade-interval` (optional: string, default: '8h')
Defines how often the Brew upgrade service should run. The string is passed directly to `OnUnitInactiveSec` in systemd timer. (Syntax: ['1d', '6h', '10m']).

#### `upgrade-wait-after-boot` (optional: string, default: '30min')
Time delay after system boot before the first Brew package upgrade runs. The string is passed directly to `OnBootSec` in systemd timer. (Syntax: ['1d', '6h', '10m']).

### Analytics

The Homebrew project uses analytics to anonymously collect the information about Brew usage & your system in order to improve the experience of Brew users.  

#### `brew-analytics` (optional: boolean, default: true)
Determines whether to opt-out of Brew analytics. When set to true, analytics are enabled.

:::caution
Please review the Brew documentation carefully before modifying the settings above.

### Nofile limits

Nofile limit refers to the maximum number of open files for a single process. For more information about this, you can read this thread:  
https://serverfault.com/questions/577437/what-is-the-impact-of-increasing-nofile-limits-in-etc-security-limits-conf

#### `nofile-limits` (optional: boolean, default: false)
Determines whether to increase nofile limits for Brew installations.  
When set to true, it increases the nofile limits to prevent certain "I/O heavy" Brew packages from failing due to "too many open files" error. However, it's important to note that increasing nofile limits can have potential security implications for malicious applications which would try to abuse storage I/O. Defaults to false for security purposes.

## Development
Setting `DEBUG=true` inside `brew.sh` will enable additional output for debugging purposes during development.

## Uninstallation

Removing the `brew` module from the recipe is not enough to get it completely removed.   
On a booted system, it's also necessary to run the `brew` uninstallation script.

Either a local-user can execute this script manually or the image-maintainer may make it automatic through a custom systemd service.

Uninstallation script:  
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Remove Homebrew cache
if [[ -d "${HOME}/cache/Homebrew/" ]]; then
  echo "Removing '$HOME/cache/Homebrew/' directory"
  rm -r "${HOME}/cache/Homebrew/"
else
  echo "'${HOME}/cache/Homebrew/' directory is already removed"
fi

# Remove folders created by tmpfiles.d
if [[ -d "/var/lib/homebrew/" ]]; then
  echo "Removing '/var/lib/homebrew/' directory"
  sudo rm -rf "/var/lib/homebrew/"
else
  echo "'/var/lib/homebrew/' directory is already removed"
fi
if [[ -d "/var/cache/homebrew/" ]]; then
  echo "Removing '/var/cache/homebrew/' directory"
  sudo rm -rf "/var/cache/homebrew/"
else
  echo "'/var/cache/homebrew/' directory is already removed"
fi
## This is the main directory where brew is located
if [[ -d "/var/home/linuxbrew/" ]]; then
  echo "Removing '/home/linuxbrew/' directory"
  sudo rm -rf "/var/home/linuxbrew/"
else
  echo "'/home/linuxbrew/' directory is already removed"
fi

# Remove redundant brew-setup service state file
if [[ -f "/etc/.linuxbrew" ]]; then
  echo "Removing empty '/etc/.linuxbrew' file"
  sudo rm -f "/etc/.linuxbrew"
else
  echo "'/etc/.linuxbrew' file is already removed"
fi
```

## Credits

Thanks a lot to Bluefin custom image maintainer [m2giles](https://github.com/m2Giles), who made this entire module possible.  
In fact, the module's logic of installing & updating/upgrading Brew is fully copied from him & Bluefin, we just made it easier & more convenient to use for BlueBuild users.
